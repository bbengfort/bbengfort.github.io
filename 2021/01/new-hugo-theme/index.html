I moved from Jekyll to Hugo for static site generation, a move that has been long overdue — and I’m very happy I’ve done it. Not only can I take advantage of a new theme with extra functionality (PaperMod in this case) but also because Hugo is written in Go, I feel like I have more control over how the site gets generated.\nA lot has been said on this topic, if you’re thinking about migrating from Jekyll to Hugo, I recommend Sara Soueidan’s blog post — the notes here are Libelli specific and are listed here more as notes than anything else.\nReasons for Switching These are my personal reasons:\nJekyll was getting very difficult to work with; I primarily used the bundle exec command, but that would fail more times than not, and because of the frequency that I was writing posts - every time I wanted to write a post I had to update a slough of dependencies. Travis-CI was failing - I had some Jekyll CI integration, but it would fail even though my pages would be built ok; it wasn’t inspiring a lot of confidence. I wanted to make changes to the site, but it seemed like I had a giant obstacle of having to update jekyll and the theme first and I’m not very good with Ruby … Jekyll was taking a long time to build - I had 106 posts before I decided to switch and it was crawling. I wanted to use Hugo for other projects that I am working on. Considerations A few key considerations while making the switch:\nI really like Hugo’s content organization system; unfortunately that would break the permalink structure from Jekyll - the solution was aliases which allowed me to redirect the old post to the new link which I liked better. Along those lines, I really liked page-bundles for organizing content. It’s a bit tricky to switch with where I’m at now, but I’m going to use it in the future I think. I selected PaperMod primarily because of the search and archive functionality – which will make finding posts on Libelli much easier. I hope to create a theme of my own someday though. Deploying on GitHub pages - moving away from Jekyll means I don’t get builds for free. I’m working on using Travis CI for deployments — we’ll see if it works after this post! I had to write a script to deal with making changes to the frontmatter to fit my new configuration, the hugo import jekyll command did seem to do a lot of work, but I still had to modify the slug and the aliases configurations as well as bring over defaults from my posts archetype.
