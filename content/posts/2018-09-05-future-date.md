title: Future Date Script
---

This is kind of a dumb post, but it's something I'm sure I'll look up in the future. I have a lot of emails where I have to send a date that's sometime in the future, e.g. six weeks from the end of a class to specify a deadline &hellip; I've just been opening a Python terminal and importing `datetime` and `timedelta` but I figured this quick script on the command line would make my life a bit easier:

{{< gist bbengfort 941b367c693f709927c7092c169124d8 >}}

And that's all there is to it, not very interesting, but something I will probably have in my `bin` for the rest of my life.
