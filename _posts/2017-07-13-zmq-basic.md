This is just a snippet with a bare bones [ZMQ](http://zeromq.org/) REQ/REP message server that passes strings back and forth. To run the server:

```
$ go run zmqmsg.go serve
```

And to send messages:

```
$ go run zmqmsg.go send "first message" "second message" "third message"
```

Probably should do more explanation what this is all about but I don't have enough time unfortunately.
