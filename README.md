## About

This page is primarily my development journal and really only contains notes and ramblings for me to refer to as I practice programming. Please feel free to read and use anything you find on this site, but note it is not meant for publication or wide public consumption. If you want to find my more formal writing, check out the [District Data Labs Blog](http://blog.districtdatalabs.com/) where I write about Python, data science, streaming, distributed systems, and more.

### Name Origin

> A libellus (plural libelli) was a document given to a Roman citizen to certify performance of a pagan sacrifice, hence demonstrating loyalty to the authorities of the Roman Empire. They could also mean certificates of indulgence, in which the confessors or martyrs interceded for apostate Christians. &mdash;[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libellus)

So these notes certify the performance of my programming, demonstrating my loyalty to Open Source development, as well as a confession of my programming sins.
