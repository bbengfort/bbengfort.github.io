Description
Network analyses are powerful methods for both visual analytics and machine learning but can suffer as their complexity increases. By embedding time as a structural element rather than a property, we will explore how time series and interactive analysis can be improved on Graph structures. Primarily we will look at decomposition in NLP-extracted concept graphs using NetworkX and Graph Tool."><meta name=author content="Benjamin Bengfort"><link rel=canonical href=https://bbengfort.github.io/2016/10/dynamics-in-graph-analysis-adding-time-as-a-structure-for-visual-and-statistical-insight/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.fc220c15db4aef0318bbf30adc45d33d4d7c88deff3238b23eb255afdc472ca6.css integrity="sha256-/CIMFdtK7wMYu/MK3EXTPU18iN7/MjiyPrJVr9xHLKY=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://bbengfort.github.io/favicon.ico><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://bbengfort.github.io/icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://bbengfort.github.io/icon.png><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://bbengfort.github.io/apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png><link rel=mask-icon href=https://bbengfort.github.io/icon.png><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://bbengfort.github.io/2016/10/dynamics-in-graph-analysis-adding-time-as-a-structure-for-visual-and-statistical-insight/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme:rgb(29, 30, 32);--entry:rgb(46, 46, 51);--primary:rgb(218, 218, 219);--secondary:rgb(155, 156, 157);--tertiary:rgb(65, 66, 68);--content:rgb(196, 196, 197);--code-block-bg:rgb(46, 46, 51);--code-bg:rgb(55, 56, 62);--border:rgb(51, 51, 51)}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-D3BE7EHHVP"></script><script>var dnt,doNotTrack=!1;if(!1&&(dnt=navigator.doNotTrack||window.doNotTrack||navigator.msDoNotTrack,doNotTrack=dnt=="1"||dnt=="yes"),!doNotTrack){window.dataLayer=window.dataLayer||[];function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments)}gtag("js",new Date),gtag("config","G-D3BE7EHHVP")}</script><meta property="og:title" content="Dynamics in Graph Analysis Adding Time as a Structure for Visual and Statistical Insight"><meta property="og:description" content="I gave this talk twice, both at PyData DC on October 24, 2016 and at PyData Carolinas on September 15, 2016.

However, as these structures become more complex or embed more information over time, both visual and algorithmic methods get messy; visual analyses suffer from the “hairball” effect, and graph algorithms require either more traversal or increased computation at each vertex. A growing area to reduce this complexity and optimize analytics is the use of interactive and subgraph techniques that model how graph structures change over time.\nIn this talk, I demonstrate two practical techniques for embedding time into graphs, not as computational properties, but rather as structural elements. The first technique is to add time as a node to the graph, which allows the graph to remain static and complete, but minimizes traversals and allows filtering. The second is to represent a single graph as multiple subgraphs where each is a snapshot at a particular time. This allows us to use time series analytics on our graphs, but perhaps more importantly, to use animation or interactive methodologies to visually explore those changes and provide meaningful dynamics.\n","wordCount":"311","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://bbengfort.github.io/bear.png","datePublished":"2016-10-24T12:00:00-05:00","dateModified":"2016-10-24T12:00:00-05:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Benjamin Bengfort"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://bbengfort.github.io/2016/10/dynamics-in-graph-analysis-adding-time-as-a-structure-for-visual-and-statistical-insight/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Libelli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bbengfort.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://bbengfort.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Libelli (Alt + H)"><img src=https://bbengfort.github.io/icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Libelli</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://bbengfort.github.io/archive/ title=archive><span>archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bbengfort.github.io/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bbengfort.github.io/search/ title="search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://bbengfort.github.io/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://bbengfort.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://bbengfort.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Dynamics in Graph Analysis Adding Time as a Structure for Visual and Statistical Insight</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2016-10-24 12:00:00 -0500 -0500'>October 24, 2016</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;2 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;311 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Benjamin Bengfort&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/bbengfort/bbengfort.github.io/tree/main/content/posts/2016-10-24-dynamics-in-graph-analysis-adding-time-as-a-structure-for-visual-and-statistical-insight.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>I gave this talk twice, both at <a href=http://pydata.org/dc2016/schedule/presentation/36/>PyData DC</a> on October 24, 2016 and at <a href=http://pydata.org/carolinas2016/schedule/presentation/39/>PyData Carolinas</a> on September 15, 2016.
