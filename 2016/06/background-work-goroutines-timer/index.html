One thing that I’m constantly doing is trying to create a background process that runs forever, and does some work at an interval. Concurrency in Go is native and therefore the use of threads and parallel processing is very simple, syntax-wise. However I am still solving problems that I wanted to make sure I recorded here.\nToday’s problem involves getting a go routine to execute a function on an interval, say every 5 seconds or something like that. The foreground process will presumably be working until finished, and we want to make sure it can gracefully shutdown the background process without a delay. In order to communicate between threads in Go, you have to use a channel. I’ve put together the work from Timer Routines And Graceful Shutdowns In Go into a single snippet to remind myself how to do this:\n The end result is a program that looks like this:\n$ go run main.go 2016/06/25 21:27:51 Main started 2016/06/25 21:27:51 Worker Started 2016/06/25 21:27:58 Action complete! 2016/06/25 21:28:03 Action complete! 2016/06/25 21:28:11 Main out! As you can see it’s seven seconds between “Worker Started” and the first “Action Complete!” (5 second delay plus 2 seconds work). The second “Action Complete!” is 5 seconds later however because the worker only waits 3 seconds to make up for the work time from the previous interval. Shutdown is called, and the program gracefully shuts down with no more actions.\n","wordCount":"256","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2016-06-26T06:52:38Z","dateModified":"2016-06-26T06:52:38Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Benjamin Bengfort"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://bbengfort.github.io/2016/06/background-work-goroutines-timer/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Libelli","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bbengfort.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"){document.body.classList.add('dark');}else if(localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"){document.body.classList.remove('dark')}else if(window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches){document.body.classList.add('dark');}</script><noscript><style type=text/css>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style><style>@media(prefers-color-scheme:dark){:root{--theme: #1d1e20;--entry: #2e2e33;--primary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.84);--secondary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.56);--tertiary: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);--content: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.74);--hljs-bg: #2e2e33;--code-bg: #37383e;--border: #333}.list{background:var(--theme)}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-track{background:0 0}.list:not(.dark)::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb{border-color:var(--theme)}}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://bbengfort.github.io accesskey=h title="Libelli (Alt + H)"><img src=/icon.png alt=logo aria-label=logo height=35>Libelli</a>
